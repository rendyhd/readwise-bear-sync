# Readwise Bear Sync
A python script to sync Readwise to Bear. 

*This is my first public Github repository. I’ve been writing Python now for a few years, however, am completely self thought and have no programming background. Everything I’ve written until now were private scripts, and not optimised for public. I’m doing my best.*

### Resources;
- [Bear X-callback-url Scheme documentation](https://bear.app/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/ "")
- [Readwise API documentation](https://readwise.io/api_deets "")

I’ve learned a lot from the following two githubs, there code was great. For this project I wanted something more suited for my needs:
- [readwise2directory by nicrivard](https://github.com/nicrivard/readwise2directory "")
- [Readwise2Bear by hardik-vala](https://github.com/hardik-vala/Readwise2Bear "")

### Todo:
- [ ] Create initial load script
- [ ] Create incremental update
- [ ] Research how to turn into Daemon
